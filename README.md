We calculate the time delay of a disordered topological insulator confined as quasi-one-dimensional
strip based on the tight-binding model. Two approaches, the field decomposition and time delay decomposition, are
tested to extract the complex energy of the discrete modes in the presence of the edge mode. The previous
discussion of time delay and DOS are mainly based on the scattering matrix, we show here that the spatial matrix of
Green’s function between the output and input can be directly used to calculate the DOS. This facilitates the
calculation of DOS because it is easier to obtain the Green’s function, in measurements and numerical simulation
such as recursive Green’s function method. When modal overlap is small, the transmitted field can be decomposed
into a superposition of discrete modes and the edge channel. This decomposition is possible even though
transmission is dominated by robust transmission in the edge state. When the upper edge mode is not coupled to the
lower edge mode via disorder, the eigenchannel time delay is then equivalent to the integral of intensity inside the
sample, whose spectrum can be decomposed into a superposition of Lorentzian lines.
